# What is Malware Encryption?
<br>
As the name suggests, Malware encryption is the encryption of the malware's code. Encrypting your code will make it more difficult for anti-viruses and EDRs to detect the malicious content. To avoid modern detection, it is a crucial technique to implement.  
<br>
*Did you know that the first virus to implement encryption was the Cascade virus in 1987?*
<br>
Encrypted malware implements two very important functions:
- Encryption: This is the function where you will be implementing an encryption algorithm to obfuscate your code.
- Decryption: This is the function that will take the encrypted contents produced by the encryption function, and use a key or reverse algorithm to return the de-obfuscated code. 
<br>

It is important to note that while encryption does aid in avoiding signature-based detection, more advanced [[detection methods]] such as heuristic analysis wont be fooled as easily. Additionally, the amount of data you encrypt may also raise suspicions for a security solution as the [entropy](https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/file-entropy/) would be significantly higher than a non-malicious application. So
<br>
## Encryption Types
<br>
Below are the encryption algorithms that I'll be covering:
- XOR
- AES
- RC4
<br>
### XOR Encryption
<br>
XOR encryption is a type of additive cipher (Caesar Cipher). An additive cipher encrypts content by shifting values a given number of places. For example, you are given the letter A in the alphabet and you apply an additive cipher that shifts the value by 4. The result you are left with is the letter E (you start with A and shift 4 places, -> B -> C -> D ->E). XOR implements an [exclusive disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_disjunction) logic or modulus 2 (%2) to shift the bits of an input. 
<br>
Here is a great example provided by Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher):

<br>
Here the logic is as follows: "Wiki's" first octet is 01010111, lets apply the encryption key to it (11110011). First were compare Wiki's first bit to the Key's first bit (0 and 1). Since there exists a 1 exclusively, the new bit will equal 1. Now let's move on to the second bit (1 and 1). Since 1 is the value for both, it is not exclusive and the resulting bit is a 0! Here is a fun way to think of it, each bit from the original text is a potential romantic partner's personality and each bit from the key is your competition's personality. Now, if your first potential partner's personality (0) doesn't match your competition's personality (1) they have no chance and you still have a shot, so the bit results in 1! On the other hand if your next partner's personality (1) matches your competition's personality (1), tough luck kiddo they're soulmates, the resulting bit is a 0. 


#### Implementation in C
<br>
I have tried my best to add comments to explain what the code is doing:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h> // Importing the Windows API library

// The XOR encryption algorithm
VOID XorByUserInputKey(IN PBYTE clearFlag, IN SIZE_T sClearFlagSize, IN PBYTE key, IN SIZE_T sKey) {
	
	for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < sClearFlagSize; i++, j++) {
		
		// if end of key, start again and reapply to remaining characters in flag
		if (j > sKey) {
			j = 0;
		}
		// applying XOR operator to bytes
		clearFlag[i] = clearFlag[i] ^ key[i];
	}
}

char clearFlag[] = {
	"Hello, World! This is some verrry scarrry stuff!"
};

char key[] = {
	"bloopblapblahbfashfaflhaiuflagfuldgaskhlfdasgfkl"
};

int main() {

	// Print out pointer address for clearFlag variable
	printf("[+] Welcome to the duerme's encryption toolset! Here is the location of your pointer: %p\n", clearFlag);
	printf("[!] If you are ready to encrypt please press <Enter>...");
	getchar();

	// Calling the XOR function to encrypt and print out obfuscated flag
	XorByUserInputKey(clearFlag, sizeof(clearFlag), key, sizeof(key));
	printf("[+] Encrypting...\n[+] Success! Here is your encrypted flag: \"%s\"\n", clearFlag);
	printf("[!] If you are ready to decrypt please press <Enter>...");
	getchar();

	// Calling the XOR again to decrypt and print original flag
	XorByUserInputKey(clearFlag, sizeof(clearFlag), key, sizeof(key));
	printf("[+] Decrypting...\n[+] Success! Here is your decrypted flag: \"%s\"\n", clearFlag);

	// Exit
	printf("[#] Press <Enter> To Quit ...");
	getchar();
	return 0;

}
```
