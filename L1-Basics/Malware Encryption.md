# What is Malware Encryption?
<br>
As the name suggests, Malware encryption is the encryption of the malware's code. Encrypting your code will make it more difficult for anti-viruses and EDRs to detect the malicious content. To avoid modern detection, it is a crucial technique to implement.  
<br>
*Did you know that the first virus to implement encryption was the Cascade virus in 1987?*
<br>
Encrypted malware implements two very important functions:
- Encryption: This is the function where you will be implementing an encryption algorithm to obfuscate your code.
- Decryption: This is the function that will take the encrypted contents produced by the encryption function, and use a key or reverse algorithm to return the de-obfuscated code.

It is important to note that while encryption does aid in avoiding signature-based detection, more advanced [[detection methods]] such as heuristic analysis wont be fooled as easily. Additionally, the amount of data you encrypt may also raise suspicions for a security solution as the [entropy](https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/file-entropy/) would be significantly higher than a non-malicious application. So

## Encryption Types
<br>
Below are the encryption algorithms that I'll be covering:
- XOR
- AES
- RC4

### XOR Encryption

XOR encryption is a type of additive cipher (Caesar Cipher). An additive cipher encrypts the values provided by a given number of places. For example, you are given the letter A in the alphabet and you apply an additive cipher that shifts the position by 4. The result you are left with is the letter E (you start with A and shift 4 places, -> B -> C -> D ->E).
