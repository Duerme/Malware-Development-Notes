# What is Malware Encryption?
<br>
As the name suggests, Malware encryption is the encryption of the malware's code. Encrypting your code will make it difficult for anti-viruses and EDRs to detect the malicious content. To avoid modern detection, it's a crucial technique to implement.  
<br>
*Did you know that the first virus to implement encryption was the Cascade virus in 1987?*
<br>
Encrypted malware implements two very important functions:
- Encryption: This is the function where you will be implementing an encryption algorithm to obfuscate your code.
- Decryption: This is the function that will take the encrypted contents produced by the encryption function, and use a key or reverse algorithm to return the de-obfuscated code.

It is important to note that while encryption does aid in avoiding signature-based detection, more advanced types of detection techniques such as heuristic analysis wont be fooled as easily.
