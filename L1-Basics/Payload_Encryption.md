# What is payload encryption?
<br>
As the name suggests, payload encryption is the encryption of the code that's placed in the malicious file. Encrypting your code will make it difficult for anti-viruses and EDRs to detect the malicious content. To avoid modern detection, it's a crucial technique to implement.

*Did you know that the first virus to implement encryption was the Cascade virus in 1987?*
