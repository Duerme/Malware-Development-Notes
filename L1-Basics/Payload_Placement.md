When placing your payload inside a [Portable Executable (PE)](https://tryhackme.com/room/dissectingpeheaders), there are several options. The location of your payload is determined by the section you choose to place it in. I will be discussing the place of payloads within the following PE sections:

- `.data`
- `.rdata`
- `.text`
- `.rsrc`

## .data Section

The `.data` section of a PE contains the initialized variables (both static and global) within a program. It's important to note that this section does not contain EXECUTE permissions.
