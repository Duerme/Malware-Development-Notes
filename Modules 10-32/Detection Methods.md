# Introductory concepts of how malware is detected

### Static/Signature Detection

A signature is a string of data that uniquely identifies a malware. Take for instance Msfvenom's x64 exec payload. The shellcode generated by Msfvenom will begin with `FC 48 83 E4 F0 E8 C0 00 00 00 41 51 41 50 52 51`. A tool such as [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) will have a database of strings that are recognized as malicious and will flag any program that has a string that matches.

Bypassing signature detection is easy, but time-consuming. Hardcoding values that can be identified in your malware should be avoided
