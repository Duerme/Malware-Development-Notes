# Introductory concepts of how malware is detected

### Static/Signature Detection

A signature is a string of data that uniquely identifies a malware. Take for instance Msfvenom's x64 exec payload. The shellcode generated by Msfvenom will begin with `FC 48 83 E4 F0 E8 C0 00 00 00 41 51 41 50 52 51`,a tool such as [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/)
