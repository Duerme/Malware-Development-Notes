# Introductory concepts of how malware is detected

### Static/Signature Detection

A signature is a string of data that uniquely identifies a malware. Take for instance Msfvenom's x64 exec payload. The shellcode generated by Msfvenom will begin with `FC 48 83 E4 F0 E8 C0 00 00 00 41 51 41 50 52 51`. A tool such as [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) will have a database of strings that are recognized as malicious and will flag any program that has a string that matches.

Bypassing signature detection is easy, but time-consuming. Hardcoding values that can be identified by tools like YARA in your malware should be avoided. 

#### Hashing Detection

Hashing detection is a subset of signature detection. It is almost identical to signature except in this method hashes (MD5, SHA256, etc.) are compared rather than strings of hex values or code. It is extremely easy to avoid this type of detection, as changing even just one byte in a program can completely change its hash value.    


#### Heuristic Detection

Heuristic detection focuses on identifying suspicious characteristics that can be present in malware that is unknown, new, or is modified from existing malware.
