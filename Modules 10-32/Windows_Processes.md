# What is a Windows Process?

A process in Windows is an application or a program that consumes system resources such as RAM (memory), Disk space, and processor time to complete a task. 

## Process Threads

A thread is a set of instructions that can be executed within a process. You can have multiple threads running concurrently within a process. Threads run in the context of a process, meaning they share the same memory space and resources, facilitating efficient communication and data sharing.

## Process Memory

Windows processes use memory to store instructions and data. When a process is created, a portion of memory is allocated to it. The operating system (OS) using a combination of virtual and physical memory to manage the process memory. Virtual memory allows a the OS to allocate more memory to the process even if it is not physically available by creating a virtual address space which is then used by applications.
