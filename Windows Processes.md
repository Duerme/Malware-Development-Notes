# What is a Windows Process?

A process in Windows is an application or a program that consumes system resources such as RAM (memory), Disk space, and processor time to complete a task. 

## Process Threads

A thread is a set of instructions that can be executed within a process. You can have multiple threads running concurrently within a process. Threads run in the context of a process, meaning they share the same memory space and resources, facilitating efficient communication and data sharing.

## Process Memory

Windows processes use memory to store instructions and data. When a process is created, a portion of memory is allocated to it. The operating system (OS) using a combination of virtual and physical memory to manage the process memory. Virtual memory allows a the OS to allocate more memory to the process even if it is not physically available by creating a virtual address space which is then used by applications. Virtual address spaces are then divided into "pages" that can be allocated to each individual process.


## Types of Memory

**Private Memory -** This type of memory is reserved for a single process and cannot be shared with other processes. This memory is used to store data that only corresponds with the process it is related to. 

**Mapped Memory -** This type of memory is shared between two or more processes. It is used to share libraries, memory segments, or files. Although this memory is visible to other processes, it is protected from being modified.

**Image Memory -** This type of memory houses the data and code of an executable. It is often related to DLL files loaded into a process' address space.
